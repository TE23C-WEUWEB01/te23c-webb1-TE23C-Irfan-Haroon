        <p>Santana is an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1966 by Mexican-born guitarist Carlos
            Santana.[10] The band has undergone various recording and performing line-ups in its history, with Santana
            being the only consistent member. After signing with Columbia Records, the band's appearance at the
            Woodstock Festival in 1969 increased their profile, and they went on to record the commercially successful
            and critically acclaimed albums Santana (1969), Abraxas (1970), and Santana III (1971). These were recorded
            by the group's "classic" line-up, featuring Gregg Rolie, Michael Carabello, Michael Shrieve, David Brown,
            and José "Chepito" Areas. Hit songs of this period include "Evil Ways", "Black Magic Woman", "Oye Como Va",
            and the instrumental "Samba Pa Ti".</p>
        <p>Following a change in line-up and musical direction in 1972, the band experimented with elements of jazz
            fusion on Caravanserai (1972), Welcome (1973), and Borboletta (1974). The band reached a new peak of
            critical and commercial success with their eighteenth album, Supernatural (1999), which included the
            Billboard Hot 100-number one singles "Smooth" (featuring Rob Thomas) and "Maria Maria" (featuring The
            Product G&B). The album peaked atop the charts in eleven countries, and sold 12 million copies domestically.
            In 2014, the "classic" line-up reunited for Santana IV (2016) and the group continue to perform and record.
